### 1. Project Overview
Our solution addresses the critical challenge of categorizing cybercrime complaints using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. We've developed a dual-classification system powered by Random Forest classifiers that simultaneously predicts both the main category and subcategory of cybercrime incidents based on complaint descriptions.

#### Key Features:
- **Robust Text Preprocessing Pipeline**:
  - Advanced text cleaning with special character removal
  - NLTK-based tokenization and lemmatization
  - Stop word removal and length filtering for improved signal
  - Support for handling non-standard text input

- **Intelligent Classification System**:
  - Dual Random Forest classifiers for category and subcategory prediction
  - TF-IDF vectorization with bi-gram support (up to 5000 features)
  - Confidence scores for each prediction
  - Balanced class weights to handle imbalanced categories

- **Data Quality Management**:
  - Automatic filtering of rare categories (configurable minimum samples)
  - Class distribution analysis and reporting
  - Empty text handling and validation
  - Stratified train-test splitting for reliable evaluation

- **Production-Ready Features**:
  - Model persistence using joblib for easy deployment
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging
  - Memory-efficient processing using pipelines
  - Progress tracking for long-running operations
  - Parallel processing support for model training

This system is designed to streamline the complaint categorization process on the National Cybercrime Report Portal (NCRP), enabling faster response times and more accurate routing of cybercrime reports to appropriate authorities.

### 2. Model Documentation

#### 2.1 Data Preprocessing
Our preprocessing pipeline implements several crucial steps to ensure optimal text classification:

**Text Cleaning:**
```python
def clean_text(text):
    # Convert to lowercase
    text = text.lower()
    # Remove special characters and numbers
    text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z\s]', '', text)
    # Remove extra whitespace
    text = ' '.join(text.split())
    return text
```

**NLP Processing:**
- Tokenization using NLTK's word_tokenize
- Custom stop words list including domain-specific terms
- WordNet lemmatization with POS tagging
- N-gram feature extraction (unigrams, bigrams, trigrams)

**Feature Engineering:**
- TF-IDF vectorization with optimized parameters
- Document frequency filtering
- Sentiment analysis features
- Text length and complexity metrics
- Custom cybercrime-specific feature extractors

#### 2.2 Model Architecture
**Primary Model Stack:**
1. Base Model: Random Forest Classifier
2. Supporting Models:
   - BERT for complex cases
   - Logistic Regression for fast classification
   - Ensemble voting system
